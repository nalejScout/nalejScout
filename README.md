- 👋 Hi, I’m @nalejScout
- 👀 I'm currently in the northern Nevada area but will be moving to Southern California within a month or so.
- 🌱 To be blatently honest, I’m probally a bit out of my place in here. I just Know I'm fastenated with the little bit I do Know about programming 
      and web design. Though not a complete novice (2 1/2 years), where I was learning my tools were limited, and I'm sure my growth stunted.
- 💞️ I’m looking to hopefully get lucky and meet one or even a small group of programmers to collab with. Individuals of simular mind, varying skill 
      levels, that would be into learning together. Taking it seriously but having fun along the way.
      Aside from my own projects, opportunities continue to come my way, but this is usually based on an understanding that I am more capable than is always 
      the case. However, I am tired of passing up on these opportunities in the field in this field I love so much.
-     I'm enrolling into a small college come next semester in order to tighten on some skills
- 📫 Like I've already said, hopefully I meet some cool Knowledge hounds on here. In the chance you yourself share any of this interest, I can most easily 
     be reached at javaspro@yahoo.com.
